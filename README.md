# ExpressJS Backend Project

This is a simple backend project built using ExpressJS, a popular Node.js framework for creating web applications and APIs. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the basic setup of an ExpressJS backend to handle HTTP requests and responses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/expressjs-backend.git
cd expressjs-backend
```

2. Install the required dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Server

To start the Express server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

The ExpressJS backend provides the following functionalities:

1. **Hello World Route:** The root endpoint `/` returns a simple "Hello, World!" message.

2. **API Endpoint:** The `/api/data` endpoint accepts GET requests and responds with a JSON object containing a sample message and timestamp.

## Usage

### Hello World Route

Send a GET request to the root endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
```

Response:

```bash
Hello, World!
```

### API Endpoint

Send a GET request to the `/api/data` endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/data
```

Response:

```json
{
  "message": "This is data from the backend!",
  "timestamp": "2023-08-04T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```
